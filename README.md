Captcha is a system used on popular websites to stop bots or automatic software to access the site. IRCTC is a popular travel website in india where people book travel tickets on trains. Because of high demand of tickets, booking during peak hours (tatkal) has a captcha image containing letters that humans have to enter to book the ticket. This supposedly stops ticket booking through automated software.
